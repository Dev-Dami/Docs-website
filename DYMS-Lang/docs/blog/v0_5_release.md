# New in DYMS v0.5: Hybrid Execution, Exception Handling, and More!

We're excited to announce the release of DYMS v0.5! This release brings a host of new features and improvements that make the language more powerful, performant, and robust.

## Hybrid Execution Engine

The most significant new feature in v0.5 is the introduction of a hybrid execution engine. This engine intelligently routes code between a high-performance bytecode VM and a flexible interpreter. This means that your scripts will run faster than ever before, while still maintaining the flexibility of an interpreted language.

## Exception Handling

DYMS now supports `try/catch` blocks for exception handling. This allows you to write more robust code that can gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations.

## Other New Features

In addition to the hybrid execution engine and exception handling, v0.5 also includes the following new features:

*   **Loop control flow:** `break` and `continue` statements are now supported in loops.
*   **Increment/decrement operators:** You can now use `++` and `--` to increment and decrement variables.
*   **Expanded standard library:** The `fmaths` module has been expanded with new functions.

We're really excited about this release, and we can't wait to see what you build with it. As always, we welcome your feedback and contributions.
